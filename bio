Intro
Hey! My name is Joseph VanSandt, and I'm a web design student at Seattle Central College. I am currently enrolled in a course for version control software, and another for web design theory. My goal is to complete the Web Dev program here and begin a career in designing user-facing content for the web!

About Me
Originally from a small town in Oklahoma, I've relocated to Seattle after serving 7 years in the Navy as an Aviation Electrician's Mate (essentially an electrician on aircraft). While that work was enjoyable and I became skilled at it, my personal interests laid more in computer work and I found my calling in web design as I learned some basic HTML and CSS when helping on a major gaming company's North American forum.
